					<h1>What We Do:</h1>
					<p><font size="+3">
						The Sun to Sea Power Transporter system takes solar energy and uses it to provide power to victims in coastal cities after natural disasters. The system utilizes geostationary satellites to collect solar energy from 36,000km above the earth's surface. This energy is converted to microwaves and is beamed to one of our modified cargo ships. These modified ships each have a 100,000m<sup>2</sup> circular rectenna array. This array absorbs the microwaves sent from the satellite, converts them to electricity using a rectenna array and stores it in Tesla Powerpacks on the ship. After a natural disaster, the ship can move close to the impacted area and deploy a smaller boat to bring the connecting cables to shore. Using a method similar to that of offshore wind turbines, the Powerpacks will send their power through the cable into the existing power grid, providing a constant and long-lasting supply of power to the affected area.

				<p>Energy Capacity: How much electricty can we can deliver?</p>
			</font>	
				<p>The ship has 50,000 Powerpacks each rated for 210kWh</p>
				<p>Each ship has a maximum energy capacity of 10.5 million kWh </p>
				<p>A house running only neccessities needs 1350kWh per year; 3.69kWh per day </p>
				<p>
					Therefore, one ship can support <strong>2.8 million houses</strong>, given each home is only using the neccessities. This is only off the maximum storage of the ship. As power is transferred to the grid, the ship will capture more microwave energy and continue to store and supply more power 
				</p>

			<font size="+2">
				<p>Sizes: How big is the system?</p>
			</font>
				<p>The satellite has a 1.6km<sup>2</sup> solar cell array </p>
				<p>The rectenna on the Maersk Triple E class ship is 100,000m<sup>2</sup> </p>
				<p>As the conversion from microwaves to electricity is 85-90% efficient, the entire ship can charge in <strong>8-12 hours</strong> (varies with temperature and weather conditions)</p>
			<font size="+2">
				<p>Cost: How much money is needed to fund this system?</p>
			</font>
				<p>SpaceX offers the cheapest viable launch service at $90 million per launch</p>
				<p>A Maersk Triple E class ship costs $185 million USD</p>
				<p>Manufacuturing costs for the satellite are around <strong>$350-400 million USD</strong></p>
