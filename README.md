Our Project, The Sun to Sea Power Transporter, system takes solar energy and uses it to provide power to victims in coastal cities after natural disasters. The system utilizes geostationary satellites to collect solar energy from 36,000km above the earth's surface. This energy is converted to microwaves and is sent to one of our modified shipping boats. These modified ships each have a 100,000m^2 circular rectenna array. This array absorbs the microwaves sent from the satellite and stores it in Tesla Powerpacks on the ship. After a natural disaster, the ship will move close to the impacted area and deploy a smaller boat to bring the connection cable to shore. Using a method similar to that of offshore wind turbines, the Powerpacks will send their power through the cable into the existing power grid.
